What are the expected values and standard errors of the number of Democrats. Hint: the answers are functions of $p$, the proportion of Democrats.

Let $S$ be the number of Democrats in our sample or the sum of the 25 draws. Our expected value is:

$$\mbox{E}(S) = 25p$$

and standard error is:

$$\mbox{SE}(S) = \sqrt{25 p (1-p)}$$

Two more intuitive results. If we divide $S$ by constant, the expected value and standard error are also divided by this constant. This implies that:

Now we know that the expected value of the proportion in our sample $S/25$ has expected value $p$.

$$\mbox{E}(S/25) = p$$

which implies that $S/25$ will be $p$ plus some chance error.

The SE,

$$\mbox{SE}(S/25) = \sqrt{p(1-p)} / \sqrt{N}$$

gives us an idea of how large the error is.

We do notice that by making $N$ larger, we can make our standard error smaller. The Law of Large Numbers tells us that the bigger $N$, the closer the sample average gets to the average of the jar, which is the quantity we want to estimate.

Can you predict how much money your casino will make on those 10,000 people? We can run a simulation of this and see how many people made $10, $9, \dots, -$10 :

n <- 10000
earnings <- replicate(n, {
  X <- sample(c(-1,1), 10, replace = TRUE, prob=c(10/19, 9/19))
  S <- -sum(X)
})
table(earnings)
We can see that as a group the people lost:

sum(earnings)

dollars, which is equivalent to our casino's earnings. But note that earnings is also a random variable.

If you run the code above repeatedly, you start appreciating the randomness. For a casino owner, it would be very convenient to actually describe this randomness precisely. We do this by deciphering the probability distribution of random variables.
